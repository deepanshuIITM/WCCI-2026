# Title of Tutorial: 

## Advances in Evolutionary Multi-criterion Optimization and Decision-making

## Short Description 

This tutorial will begin with a quick overview of the fundamentals of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), followed by a summary of widely used EMO algorithms, standard test problems, performance metrics, and application case studies. A brief introduction to a few multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches will also be provided. The main focus, however, will be on recent advancements in EMO that highlight its growing importance in practical problem-solving, including partial Pareto-set search, knowledge discovery, robust and reliability-based optimization, multi-objectivization techniques, regularized EMO, innovation path discovery, bilevel multi-objective optimization, and surrogate-assisted optimization. These topics aim to give participants a deeper understanding of the scope of EMO and inspire new research directions. A key component of the tutorial will be the Machine-DM concept, which uses trained machine learning (ML) models to emulate human decision makers and enables the creation of benchmark problems for interactive MCDM. With publicly available ML-based machine-DMs, both EMO and ML researchers can now design and compare new MCDM strategies more effectively. This integration is expected to attract interest from the EC and ML communities, making WCCI-2026 an ideal venue for this tutorial. To further engage participants, the tutorial will include hands-on simulations demonstrating EMO algorithms for generating Pareto fronts and the Machine-DM framework for selecting preferred solutions using Bench-iMCDM methods. GitHub resources and code examples will be introduced to support practical understanding and future exploration.
